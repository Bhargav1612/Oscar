The 1st paragraph is little advanced. Make it into simple tone:

This year marked a significant milestone as I embarked on my professional journey at Verizon India. My initial stint as an intern provided a deep dive into the company’s dynamic culture and organizational structure. Through consistent effort, I ensured timely completion of all assigned training modules, aligning with my learning objectives. I actively participated in hackathons, where I proposed innovative solutions, and engaged in leadership meetings, gaining exposure to high-level decision-making and building connections with senior stakeholders.

During my internship, I acquired hands-on experience with several key technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I worked on developing various web features and successfully created a fully functional website using React and other frontend technologies. This project not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of web development best practices.

After transitioning to a full-time role, I shifted to iOS development, a domain in which I had no prior experience. Despite this, I quickly adapted, mastering fundamental iOS concepts in a short span of time. I soon contributed to a critical project, developing a native search feature. This involved integrating search history and implementing a voice recognition functionality. I delivered this feature in two versions: one for a new page and another for an in-page search experience, showcasing my ability to handle diverse technical requirements efficiently.

Beyond development, I actively engaged in broader team initiatives under MVA, contributing to pulse surveys, AHM meetings, and DTP calls. Additionally, I participated in Citizen Verizon activities, furthering community outreach, and joined events like the GUSTO Sports event. These experiences enriched my professional journey and fostered a stronger connection with my colleagues and the organization’s mission.
